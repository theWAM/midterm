# Mobile App Development Midterm

This project aims to create an app with an Authentication class in Flutter that allows for the following Firebase authentication methods to be implemented:

1. Email with Password
2. Email without Password
3. Phone number
4. Facebook
5. Google
6. Anonymous

This method also allows for users to verify their email and sign out.

# How this App Works

● My app first begins with having a splash screen appear with a picture of me and the title Midterm App.

● It then takes you to my login page where you will be presented with different login options, mainly the ones stated below.

- Email with Password
- Email without Password
- Phone number
- Facebook
- Google
- Anonymous

● If you choose to click the register button, it will take you to the register page and after you register, you will be logged in.

● If you are already an existing user, you can log in with your email address and (password) through the different sign in options.

● Once a user logs in they will be directed to the home page that has a list screen that shows all users registered from this app.

● Each list item displays a picture of the user, the name of the user, and the date the user joined.

● Each item is clickable, and on tap navigates to a new screen, which shows the user's name, picture, bio, hometown, and age. There is also a button that allows you to navigate back to the previous list page.

● My App works for Android and iOS.

# How to Run this App:

Clone this repository locally and run the command `flutter run`. This app was developed in Android Studio.
